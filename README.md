# Book-Search-Engine-GraphQL-MERN

## Description:

Given starter code of a fully functioning Google Books API search engine built with a RESTful API, and refactor it to be a GraphQL API built with Apollo Server. The app was built using the MERN stack with a React front end, MongoDB database, and Node.js/Express.js server and API. It's already set up to allow users to save book searches to the back end.

## User Setup:

To use this at home, in your terminal run the following commands to invoke the application:
`npm i` to install packages,
then `npm run start` starts the live server.

## User Story

```md
AS AN avid reader
I WANT to search for new books to read
SO THAT I can keep a list of books to purchase
```

## planning notes:

1. Copy the RESTful API starter code to convert to GraphQL

2. Set up an Apollo Server to use GraphQL queries and mutations to fetch and modify data, replacing the existing RESTful API.

3. Modify the existing authentication middleware so that it works in the context of a GraphQL API.

4. Create an Apollo Provider so that requests can communicate with an Apollo Server.

5. Deploy your application to Heroku with a MongoDB database using MongoDB Atlas.

## Commit notes:

1. Created Readme, setup folders, and created the mutations and queries on the backend of application.
